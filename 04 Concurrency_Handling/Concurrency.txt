Question
    Scenario: You are developing a Node.js application where users can book events. The event booking system should prevent double bookings for the same event.
    Requirements:
    Describe how you would handle concurrent booking requests to ensure that an event cannot be booked more than once at the same time.
    Suggest a strategy for implementing this in both the application code and the database schema.

Solution

Handling Concurrent Booking Requests: To prevent double bookings, you can use database-level locking and transactional handling.

    In the application code: Use optimistic locking by checking the availability of an event before booking. Implement this with a transaction:
        Begin a transaction.
        Check the availability of the event (e.g., number of available seats).
        If available, proceed with the booking and commit the transaction.
        If unavailable, roll back.
    In the database schema:

        Use unique constraints on the combination of user_id and event_id in the bookings table to prevent duplicate bookings.
        If using SQL, employ FOR UPDATE locking when reading the event availability during a transaction to ensure concurrent reads and writes are managed.
