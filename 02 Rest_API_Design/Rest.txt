Question
    Scenario: You need to design a REST API endpoint to retrieve user profile information. The endpoint should support fetching a user's profile by their username and include optional query parameters for filtering the results.
    Requirements:
    Define the endpoint URL and HTTP method.
    Specify the expected request parameters and response structure.
    Explain how you would handle errors (e.g., user not found) and validate input.


Solution

Define the endpoint URL and HTTP method
--------------------------------­---
The endpoint URL for retrieving a user's profile information is `/users/{username}`. The HTTP method
for this endpoint is `GET`.

Explain how you would handle errors (e.g., user not found) and validate input.
------------------------------------------------­---
To handle errors and validate input, we can use the following strategies:
1.  **Error Handling**: Implement a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur
during the execution of the endpoint. For example, if the user is not found, a `
404 Not Found` error can be raised.
2.  **Input Validation**: Validate the input parameters to ensure they are in the correct format and
within the expected range. For instance, the `username` parameter should be a string and not empty
3.  **Optional Query Parameters**: Use query parameters to filter the results. For example, we
can use `?active=true` to retrieve only active users.
